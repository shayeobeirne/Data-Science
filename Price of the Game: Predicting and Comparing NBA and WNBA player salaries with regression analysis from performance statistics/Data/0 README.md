We obtained our data by using the BeautifulSoup Package in Python to scrape various publicly-accesible websites, more specifically ESPN.com and CBS Sports
for both NBA and WNBA player performance statistics, and basketball-reference.com and spotrac.com for data regarding player salaries. After scraping each 
of the respective websites, we loaded the data into two CSV's, where we proceeded to clean the data and use for analysis.
